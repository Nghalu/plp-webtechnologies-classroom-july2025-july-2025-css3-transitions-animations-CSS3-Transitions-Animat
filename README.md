# CSS & JavaScript Interactive Webpage
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to bring web pages to life using CSS3 transitions & animations combined with JavaScript functions.
It was created as part of an assignment to show:
- Dynamic styling with CSS
- Functional logic with JavaScript (parameters, scope, return values)
- Integration of CSS & JS for interactive experiences
## Features
### Part 1: CSS Transitions & Animations
- Button hover effect with smooth scaling and background color change.
- Fade-in heading using @keyframes.
- Box element that rotates and scales with transition effects.
### Part 2: JavaScript Functions
- Functions with parameters and return values (incrementCounter).
- Demonstration of local vs global scope (animationCount).
- Functions reused to toggle animations and handle modal visibility.
### Part 3: CSS + JS Integration
- A button triggers box rotation and color change by toggling CSS classes.
- A modal popup that slides in and fades out, controlled by JavaScript.
- Reusable functions to show/hide elements dynamically.
